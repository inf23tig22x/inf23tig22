                    <h3>Ancient Civilizations</h3>
                    <p>In ancient Egypt, archery was crucial for both hunting and military tactics, with composite bows
                        made
                        from wood, horn, and sinew. The Greeks and Romans also used archers, although less prominently.
                        Greek
                        mythology and Roman military included notable references to archery.</p>

                    <h3>Asian Influence</h3>
                    <p>China advanced bow-making techniques and developed the repeating crossbow. In Japan, archery
                        evolved
                        into
                        Kyudo, emphasizing meditative shooting. The Mongols, famous for their horseback archery,
                        expanded
                        their
                        empire significantly through their archery skills.</p>

                    <h3>Medieval Europe</h3>
                    <p>The longbow became a pivotal weapon in medieval warfare, especially in England during the Hundred
                        Years'
                        War. Its effectiveness in battle was legendary.</p>

                    <h3>Modern Revival</h3>
                    <p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, archery transitioned into a competitive sport. Organizations
                        standardized
                        rules and promoted competitions. Archery was reintroduced to the Olympics in 1972 and has since
                        grown in
                        popularity.</p>
